DK Telecom Supporting IOM in The Gambia
Migration has always been part of Gambian life. With over 118,000 Gambians living
abroad and remittances contributing more than 20 percent of the national GDP,
migration shapes families, communities, and the country’s future. Yet alongside these
opportunities, challenges such as irregular migration, human trafficking, and the
reintegration of returnees remain pressing issues. Since 2001, the International
Organization for Migration (IOM) has been working in The Gambia to respond to these
realities, becoming a full country office in 2017.
From helping thousands of returnees rebuild their lives, to partnering with the
Government of The Gambia in shaping the first National Migration Policy, IOM plays a
vital role in protecting vulnerable migrants and guiding evidence-based migration
governance. This important work relies on one key enabler: reliable and secure
connectivity.

activities possible.
For IOM, dependable communication is more than just a technical need; it is essential
for delivering protection, hope, and sustainable solutions to migrants and their families.
By providing this backbone, DK Telecom is not only supplying the internet but also
supporting a mission that touches thousands of Gambian lives. It is a partnership that
reflects our belief that technology should serve people, strengthen institutions, and
contribute to the country’s development.

USET
Supporting Education Through Connectivity
We believe that staying connected goes far beyond electronic gadgets and data utility, of course
it's about being present for the moments that truly matter to the community too. One of those
moments was the historic inauguration of the Brikama Campus of the University of Applied
Science, Engineering and Technology (USET), which also marked the graduation of its first
cohort and marked the first TVET University graduation in the country.
When we were invited to provide coverage for this milestone event, we did not hesitate. It was

to celebrate achievement, ambition, and the power of education in our community and support
with relevant visibility materials added a relevant value in this remarkable event.

throughout the event, ensuring that graduates, families, the media and well-wishers near and far
are connected and could share in the joy of this special day.
